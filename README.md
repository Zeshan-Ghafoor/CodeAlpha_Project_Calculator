# CodeAlpha_Project_Calculator
The "Calculator" project is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML structure defines the layout of the calculator, while CSS is used to style the buttons, display, and overall interface for a clean and user-friendly design. JavaScript handles the logic behind the calculations, ensuring that inputs and operations are processed correctly. This project demonstrates the integration of front-end technologies to create an interactive and functional tool.
